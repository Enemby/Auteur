# Auteur
 A tiny tool for automatically crediting collaborators
 ## What does it do?
 Auteur is a GUI based (with [terminal options](https://github.com/Enemby/Auteur/wiki/Launch-Options) ) tool for crediting anyone involved with your projects. Each author can instantly create a .atr file in Auteur and place it in a folder with their assets. Then, Auteur can be used to scan the entire project for these files and create an up to date list, crediting everyone involved automatically, and can interact with terminal scripting to be added automatically with every release.
## Why did I make this?
The short answer is that the games' industry has a huge, huge problem with properly crediting everyone involved with large, AAA releases. I intend to remove barriers to make crediting your coworkers and outsourced assets as easy as possible, to the point of literally being a button press or less. I've named the tool Auteur after the myth of solo developers making groundbreaking games. The reality is that they're almost always building off of decades of work that is improperly credited, hence the Auteur title.
## Who can use it?
Currently, this should run for anyone on a windows PC, though the GUI requires a semi modern video card and processor currently. Also, you should have at least 1 gig of memory available, more if your project is bigger.
### What's your tech stack?
Currently Auteur is built in Unity 2020.1.1, and Visual Studio 2019, but it's not married to either tool and can be easily ported.
